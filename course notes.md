# Cplusplus-Program
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project was about making a banking application to calculate interest with and without monthly deposits. We designed and coded a menu and otions to for the user to
input data and then use this data to display the interest earned over the amount of years the user entered.

What did you do particularly well?

I think I did pretty good overall I liked how the final display came out. It looks nice and was easier to code than I thought it would be. 

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

The menu could maybe be done better I'm not sure. The other part that could maybe do with some inprovment is the calculation for the interest I was a little unsure 
when making it if I was doing it right so I'm sure there is probably a better way to do it. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

As I said before the calculation was the part I was most unsure about. I had to look up the equation for interest and then I did my best to impliment it into the program. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

The most useful skill from this project was using header files and multiple .cpp file in a project. Beofre this course I had not used multiple file in a single program very much. Getting the practice from this project was very useful to get a better understanding of this concept. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I tried my best to make the code as simple and efficient as I could that way there it is easy to read and understand what the sode is doing. Doing so has made it so any other programer could come in and change it if something needs to be adjusted or fixed.
