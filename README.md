# CS 210 C++ Program Description

This repo contains code from my time in the Programming Languages course. This course focused on object-oriented programming, primarily using C++ in Visual Studio to build secure, efficient, and professional applications. The course covered data structures, algorithms, and software development methodologies through labs and projects. The project for this course was about making a banking application to calculate interest with and without monthly deposits. We designed and coded a menu and options for the user to input data and then use this data to display the interest earned based on the number of years the user entered.
